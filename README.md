# Decision Tree Classification
Decisions tress (DTs) are the most powerful non-parametric supervised learning method. They can be used for the classification and regression tasks. The main goal of DTs is to create a model predicting target variable value by learning simple decision rules deduced from the data features. Decision trees have two main entities; one is root node, where the data splits, and other is decision nodes or leaves, where we got final output.
